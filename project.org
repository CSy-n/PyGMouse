** Session #2


*** The `mouse_move_delayed' bug

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    nx = sx + (x - sx) * (ct - st) / delay
    ny = sy + (y - sy) * (ct - st) / delay
#+END_SRC

This code is resulting in:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
ValueError: Point out of bounds
#+END_VERSE






















** Session #3




 - A circle is 2 * pi * r
 - Each `swirl' is 2 Radians - theta
 

circumference = 2 * pi * r * resolution
length = radius * circumference 


n = dy

n = ie



#+BEGIN_SRC python
r = 
#+END_SRC
